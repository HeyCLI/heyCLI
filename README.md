```
curl -o heycli_client.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/HeyCLI/heyCLI/main/heycli_client.sh

2. Source the script, type in your terminal:  

```
source heycli_client.sh
```

3. Go grab an API token here: https://signup.heycli.com/

4. Finally, set the HEYCLI_API_KEY environment variable in your terminal:
